      <description>Hi Winnipeg, ManitobaI’m kicking off 2020 with a data blogging experiment, centered on exploring openly available Winnipeg data.
Why?
First, as a early career data scientist, I’ve been spending a bunch of time working through data on Winnipeg and other Canadian cities. More of it turned out to be interesting than I initially expected, so I thought I’d start sharing some of it here. Plus, a blog seems like a good venue to try out (and record, for my future self) some new analysis techniques.</description>
