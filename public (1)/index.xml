      <description>What is “good for a city”?I’ve been in a few “green feild” data science positions now—positions where orgs know they need to “leverage data” to avoid falling behind, but aren’t quite sure how they should make use of their data or what potential ends data sceince can be directed towards.
I’m not really interested in writing another post about whether or when orgs should invest in data science.</description>

      <description>Hi Winnipeg, ManitobaI’m kicking off 2020 with a data blogging experiment, centered on exploring openly available Winnipeg data.
Why?
First, as a early career data scientist, I’ve been spending a bunch of time working through data on Winnipeg and other Canadian cities. More of it turned out to be interesting than I initially expected, so I thought I’d start sharing some of it here. Plus, a blog seems like a good venue to try out (and record, for my future self) some new analysis techniques.</description>

      <description>I’m currently employed as a data scientist and consultant. I work on a broad range of topics, but recurring themes include: marketing, merchandising, and sales modeling, forecasting, GIS, geostatistics, spatial statistics, and data visualization.
Before that, I worked on modeling rational norms and cognitive limitations as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Toronto with Jonathan Weisberg. I received my doctorate from the University of Southern California in 2015, working on similar themes with Kenny Easwaran, Ralph Wedgwood, Jacob Ross, and Richard Arratia (mathematics).</description>
