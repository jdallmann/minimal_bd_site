I'm currently employed as a data scientist and consultant. I work on a broad range of topics, but recurring themes include: marketing, merchandising, and sales modeling, forecasting, GIS, geostatistics, spatial statistics, and data visualization.

Before that, I worked on modeling rational norms and cognitive limitations as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Toronto with [Jonathan Weisberg](http://www.utm.utoronto.ca/~weisber3/). I received my doctorate from the University of Southern California in 2015, working on similar themes with [Kenny Easwaran](http://www.kennyeaswaran.org/), [Ralph Wedgwood](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~wedgwood/), [Jacob Ross](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~jacobmro/), and [Richard Arratia](http://dornsife.usc.edu/cf/faculty-and-staff/faculty.cfm?pid=1003062) (mathematics).

I have an MA from the University of Manitoba on Bayesian measures of confirmation---the theory of what evidentially impacts what---under [Rhonda Martens](http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/arts/departments/philosophy/facstaff/martens.html), [Chris Tillman](https://sites.google.com/site/christillman/home), and [Brad C. Johnson](https://www.sci.umanitoba.ca/statistics/profiles/bradjohnson/) (statistics). Every now and then I also sit a Society of Actuaries exam.
