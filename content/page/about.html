<p>I currently work as a data scientist and consultant. I work on a broad range of topics, but recurring themes include: marketing, merchandising, and sales modeling, forecasting, GIS, geo-statistics, spatial statistics, and data visualization.</p>
<p>Before that, I worked on modeling rational norms and cognitive limitations as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Toronto with <a href="http://www.utm.utoronto.ca/~weisber3/">Jonathan Weisberg</a>. I received my doctorate from the University of Southern California in 2015, working on silimar themes with <a href="http://www.kennyeaswaran.org/">Kenny Easwaran</a>, <a href="http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~wedgwood/">Ralph Wedgwood</a>, <a href="http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~jacobmro/">Jacob Ross</a>, and <a href="http://dornsife.usc.edu/cf/faculty-and-staff/faculty.cfm?pid=1003062">Richard Arratia</a> (mathematics).</p>
<p>I have an MA from the University of Manitoba on Bayesian measures of confirmation—the theory of what evidentially impacts what—under <a href="http://umanitoba.ca/faculties/arts/departments/philosophy/facstaff/martens.html">Rhonda Martens</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/christillman/home">Chris Tillman</a>, and <a href="http://www.umanitoba.ca/statistics/people/bjohnson/">Brad C. Johnson</a> (statistics). Every now and then I also sit a Society of Actuaries exam.</p>
