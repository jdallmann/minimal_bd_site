<div id="hi-winnipeg-manitoba" class="section level1">
<h1>Hi Winnipeg, Manitoba</h1>
<p>I’m kicking off 2020 with a data blogging experiment, centered on exploring openly available Winnipeg data.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>First, as a early career data scientist, I’ve been spending a bunch of time working through data on Winnipeg and other Canadian cities. More of it turned out to be interesting than I initially expected, so I thought I’d start sharing some of it here. Plus, a blog seems like a good venue to try out (and record, for my future self) some new analysis techniques. If other data nerds might benefit, all the better.</p>
<p>Second, I’m kind of attached to this city. I’ve left it for larger (and obviously warmer) cities before, but it has a way of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L4cttwNaDs">charming you into returning</a>…</p>
<p>It is the primary location of maybe the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_River_Rebellion">least boring saga in Canadian history</a>, super <a href="https://www.naturemanitoba.ca/">bio-diverse</a>, seasonally diverse (perhaps for the worse), and often <a href="https://shawglobalnews.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/tracy-eyolfson-winnipeg-new.jpg">hit</a> by <a href="https://www.travelmanitoba.com/things-to-do/all-seasons/aurora-borealis-northern-lights/">unexpected beauty</a> that, I’d argue, rivals that of the “pretty provinces”. Plus, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8L4cttwNaDs">cultural references</a> to our <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2019/11/its-cool-to-be-cold-confessions-of-frigid-weather-fanatics/">“frigid Tundra”</a>, really give it that international allure.</p>
<p>Lastly, it would be great to contribute to a data-based conversation about our city. As the place we live and pay to maintain as tax-payers, pretty much everyone has a view on it. Encouraging double-checking (or single-checking) those views against data would be a plus. So, let’s engage in some baseless speculation together (a favorite past-time), and self-correct against actual data (another favourite past-time). Maybe we’ll get somewhere together.</p>
