      <description>Hi Winnipeg, ManitobaI’m kicking off 2020 with a data blogging experiment, centered on exploring openly available data on Winnipeg.
Why? Mostly because it lines up well with my current interests and activities.
First, as a early career data scientist, I’ve been spending a bunch of time working through data on Winnipeg and other Canadian cities. More of it turned out to be interesting than I initially expected, so I thought I’d start sharing some of it here.</description>
