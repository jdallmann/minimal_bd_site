I received my doctorate in philosophy at the University of Southern California in 2015, working with Kenny Easwaran, Ralph Wedgwood, Jacob Ross, and Richard Arratia (mathematics).\nI continue to actively pursue research in epistemology, the foundations of uncertain inference, cognitive science, and the ethics of machine learning. This research comes together over questions like:  \"What should we believe in light of our evidence?\", \"What is evidence and what is evidential impact?\", \"How should we respond to information given our cognitive limitations?\" \"How does our believing a proposition relate to our confidence that that proposition obtains?\", and  \"How are accurate predictions related to rational belief and action?  -- I have an MA in Philosophy from the University of Manitoba on Bayesian measures of confirmation—the theory of what evidentially impacts what—under Rhonda Martens, Chris Tillman, and Brad C. Johnson (statistics). I received an honors degree in Philosophy with undeclared majors in mathematics and statistics at the University of Manitoba. Every now and then I also sit a Society of Actuaries exam.\nYou can find my CV here and four generations of my academic genealogy here:\nfour generations of my academic genealogy\n ","href":"/about/","title":"About"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/config/","title":"Configuration"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/og/","title":"Opengraph"},{"content":"","href":"/search/","title":"Search"},{"content":"","href":"/series/","title":"Series"}]
