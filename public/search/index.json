[{"content":" A blog dedicated to sometimes serious, mostly not-so-serious, data analysis concerning the City of Winnipeg\u0026mdash;often using R \u0026amp; openly available data.\n ","href":"/","title":"Home"},{"content":"\rHi Winnipeg, Manitoba\rI’m kicking off 2020 with a data blogging experiment, centered on exploring openly available data on Winnipeg.\nWhy? Mostly because it lines up well with my current interests and activities.\nFirst, as a early career data scientist, I’ve been spending a bunch of time working through data on Winnipeg and other Canadian cities. More of it turned out to be interesting than I initially expected, so I thought I’d start sharing some of it here. Plus, a blog seems like a good venue to try out (and record, for my future self) some new analytic techniques. If other data nerds might benefit, all the better.\nSecond, I’m kind of attached to this city. I’ve left it for larger (and obviously warmer) cities before, but it has a way of charming you into returning…\nIt is the central location of maybe the least boring saga in Canadian history, super bio-diverse, seasonally diverse (perhaps for the worse), and often hit by unexpected beauty that, I’d argue, rivals that of the “pretty provinces”. Plus, cultural references to our “frigid Tundra”, really give it that international allure.\nLastly, it would be great to contribute to a data-based conversation about our city. Because it’s a public entity, paid for by public money, pretty much everyone had a view on it. Encouraging double-checking (or single-checking) those views against data would be a plus. So, let’s engage in some baseless speculation together (a favorite past-time), and self-correct against actual data (another favourite past-time). Maybe we’ll get somewhere together.\n\rTalk soon Winnipeg Data nerds!\n All of the views expressed on this blog are my own opinions, all data is openly available, and all analyses coded using reproducible research methods posted to Github in the link below. \n\r","href":"/post/20200101-hello_winnipeg/","title":"Hello Winnipeg \u0026 Winnipeg Data Nerds"},{"content":"publications  \u0026ldquo;When Obstinacy is a Better (Cognitive) Policy,\u0026quot; Philosophers\u0026rsquo; Imprint, 2017.

I received my doctorate in philosophy at the University of Southern California in 2015, working with Kenny Easwaran, Ralph Wedgwood, Jacob Ross, and Richard Arratia (mathematics).\nI continue to actively pursue research in epistemology, the foundations of uncertain inference, cognitive science, and the ethics of machine learning. This research comes together over questions like:  \"What should we believe in light of our evidence?\", \"What is evidence and what is evidential impact?\", \"How should we respond to information given our cognitive limitations?\" \"How does our believing a proposition relate to our confidence that that proposition obtains?\", and  \"How are accurate predictions related to rational belief and action?  -- I have an MA in Philosophy from the University of Manitoba on Bayesian measures of confirmation—the theory of what evidentially impacts what—under Rhonda Martens, Chris Tillman, and Brad C. Johnson (statistics). I received an honors degree in Philosophy with undeclared majors in mathematics and statistics at the University of Manitoba. Every now and then I also sit a Society of Actuaries exam.\nYou can find my CV here and four generations of my academic genealogy here:\nfour generations of my academic genealogy\n ","href":"/about/","title":"About"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/config/","title":"Configuration"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/og/","title":"Opengraph"},{"content":"","href":"/search/","title":"Search"},{"content":"","href":"/series/","title":"Series"}]
